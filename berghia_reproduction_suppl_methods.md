## Feeding Schedule for Time-Based Isolation Experiment
About 3 weeks after they were laid, a group of roughly 300 early juveniles were initially fed 1-5 small E. diaphana (<1 mm pedal disk diameter, <5 mm column height) every other day. For the first two weeks of feeding, two small E. diaphana were fed every other day to the 300 juveniles. From 2 to 4 wpf, groups of 11 were fed 1 small E. diaphana every other day. From 4 to 5 wpf, groups of 9 were fed 2 small E. diaphana every other day. After 5 wpf, groups were fed one-sixth of a medium E. diaphana (2-4 mm pedal disk diameter, 10-25 mm column height) for the remainder of the experiment. Isolated juveniles were fed 2 medium E. diaphana tentacles each every other day from 4 to 8 wpf. From 8 to 12 wpf, isolated juveniles were fed 3 medium E. diaphana tentacles every other day. After 12 wpf, isolated juveniles were fed one-twelfth of a medium E. diaphana.

### Supplemental Table 1. Individuals of Berghia stephanieae in the time-based isolation experiment were fed every other day.

| Age | Group Feeding (average # of individual B. stephanieae) | Isolated individuals |
|---|---|---|
| 0-2 wpf | 1-5 small E. diaphana (~300) | - |
| 2-4 wpf | 1 small E. diaphana (11) | - |
| 4-5 wpf | 2 small E. diaphana (9) | 2 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 5-6 wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (9) | 2 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 6-8 wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (6) | 2 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 8-10 wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (4) | 3 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 10-12 wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (3) | 3 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 12+ wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (2) | 1/12 medium E. diaphana |
