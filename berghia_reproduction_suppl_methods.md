## Feeding Schedule for Time-Based Isolation Experiment
About 3 weeks after they were laid, a group of roughly 300 early juveniles were initially fed 1-5 small E. diaphana (<1 mm pedal disk diameter, <5 mm column height) every other day. For the first two weeks of feeding, two small E. diaphana were fed every other day to the 300 juveniles. From 2 to 4 wpf, groups of 11 were fed 1 small E. diaphana every other day. From 4 to 5 wpf, groups of 9 were fed 2 small E. diaphana every other day. After 5 wpf, groups were fed one-sixth of a medium E. diaphana (2-4 mm pedal disk diameter, 10-25 mm column height) for the remainder of the experiment. Isolated juveniles were fed 2 medium E. diaphana tentacles each every other day from 4 to 8 wpf. From 8 to 12 wpf, isolated juveniles were fed 3 medium E. diaphana tentacles every other day. After 12 wpf, isolated juveniles were fed one-twelfth of a medium E. diaphana.

### Supplemental Table 1. Individuals of Berghia stephanieae in the time-based isolation experiment were fed every other day.

| Age | Group Feeding (average # of individual B. stephanieae) | Isolated individuals |
|---|---|---|
| 0-2 wpf | 1-5 small E. diaphana (~300) | - |
| 2-4 wpf | 1 small E. diaphana (11) | - |
| 4-5 wpf | 2 small E. diaphana (9) | 2 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 5-6 wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (9) | 2 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 6-8 wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (6) | 2 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 8-10 wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (4) | 3 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 10-12 wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (3) | 3 tentacles from medium E. diaphana |
| 12+ wpf | ⅙ medium E. diaphana (2) | 1/12 medium E. diaphana |

### Supplemental Figure 1. Size categories of Berghia stephanieae. 
A-C. Dorsal view of B. stephanieae at 3 lengths measured from mouth to end of cerata. Measurements for all individuals were made from the anterior-most part of the head to the most posterior cerata as indicated in A. Small juveniles (6 mm) are unable to exchange sperm, and produce unfertilized egg masses after several more weeks of growth. B. Large juveniles (9 mm) function as males, and are able to exchange and store sperm, producing primarily fertilized egg masses after a few weeks of additional growth. C. Adults are mature hermaphrodites (~12-20 mm), able to exchange and store sperm, and produce fertilized egg masses immediately. Scale bar = 5 mm.
